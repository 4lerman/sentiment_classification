## 🚀 Features
- ✅ **Uses BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers)** for sentiment classification.
- ✅ **Preprocesses text** by removing HTML tags, special characters, and stopwords.
- ✅ **Visualizes word clouds** for positive and negative reviews.
- ✅ **Trains and evaluates a model** to predict sentiment.
- ✅ **Achieves high accuracy** on sentiment classification.

## 🛠️ Installation

First, install the required dependencies:
```sh
pip install tensorflow transformers pandas beautifulsoup4 matplotlib plotly wordcloud scikit-learn
```

##📜 Usage
1.	Preprocess the dataset
